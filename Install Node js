1- Introduction

Node.js is a JavaScript run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. 
It’s used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser.
NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code. 
It’s you to install software (bootstrap package, libraries, plugins, framework, and applications).

4- How to Uninstall Node.js and NPM on Windows

- Click the Start button > Settings (gear icon) >  Apps.
- Scroll down to find Node.js and click to highlight.
- Select Uninstall. This launches a wizard to uninstall the software

5- Basic Node.js Usage
Node.js is a framework, which means that it doesn’t work as a normal application. 
Instead, it interprets commands that you write. To test your new Node.js installation, create a Hello World script.

 var http = require('http');
 http.createServer(function (req, res) {
   res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
   res.end('Hello World!');
 }).listen(8080);

- Save the file, then exit. Open the PowerShell, and enter the following:
  node \users\<your_username>\myprogram.js
  Example open powershell 
	node C:\Users\Dell\Desktop\mynode.js
- It will look like nothing has happened. In reality, your script is running in the background. 
You may see a Windows Defender notice about allowing traffic – for now, click Allow.
Next, open a web browser, and enter the following into the address bar:
http://localhost:8080
